Assignments from Python for Everybody in Python3

The codes below are working Python 3 codes meant for the different assignments in the Coursera Python Specialisation (Python for Everybody)
The codes will stop updating once the assignments for every specialisation has been uploaded

These codes are mostly for my own reference in the future, however I have put it up online in case anyone else wants to see how I solve the problems.
