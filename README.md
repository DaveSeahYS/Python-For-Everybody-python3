# Python-For-Everybody-python3
Assignments from Python for Everybody in Python3

The codes below are working Python 3 codes meant for the different assignments in the Coursera Python Specialisation (Python for Everybody)
The codes will stop updating once the assignments for every specialisation has been uploaded

These codes are mostly for my own reference in the future, however I have put it up online in case anyone else wants to see how I solve the problems.

Note that due to Coursera's honor code policies, you are to refrain from copying anything blindly and must try your best to solve them before looking up other codes/
